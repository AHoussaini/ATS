Volume is an important indicator in technical analysis as it is used to measure the relative worth of a market move. If the markets make a strong price movement, then the strength of that movement depends on the volume for that period.  The higher the volume during the price move, the more significant the move. Fundamental analysis is based on company performance and is used to determine which stock to buy. Technical analysis is based on stock price and is used to determine when to buy. Technical analysts are primarily looking for entry and exit price points, and volume levels provide clues about where the best entry and exit points are located.
